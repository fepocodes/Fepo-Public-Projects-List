Telegram User Bot
----------------------
## Telegram Inbox Wizard 📬✨
## What it does 🚀
This tiny Node.js project signs in as a Telegram account and greets private contacts, politely declines voice notes, forwards your saved audio replies, and archives every conversation to text files in real time.

## Perfect for 🎯
It suits solo entrepreneurs who handle many chats, hobbyists who want to keep neat backups of their talks, and anyone who prefers written messages over audio.

## What you need 🛠️
You only supply a Telegram API ID, a Telegram API Hash, plus paths for the session file and the database folder.

## Why it feels good 💖
The whole logic lives in a single file so you can read everything in one glance.
There are no complex parts because each action is wrapped in short clear functions.
Configuration stays simple thanks to dotenv and a compact config object that maps directly to your environment variables.
ChatGPT can rewrite or extend any section quickly since the flow is linear and self contained.
The full source code is already in your hands.
The script plays nicely with other Node code because it relies only on standard modules and the TDLib client.

## Start imagining use cases 🌟
Turn the bot into a lightweight help desk that auto answers common questions.
Let it collect chat transcripts for sentiment analysis.
Ask it to forward every interesting voice note to your work group after converting it to text.

Everything is ready for you to tweak, deploy, and integrate without breaking a sweat.
