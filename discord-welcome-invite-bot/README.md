Onlyfans Telegram IA user bot
----------------------
## üöÄ Telegram and Chaindesk UserBot Overview

## üóÇÔ∏è File and Configuration Layout
One JavaScript file contains the entire logic so nothing is scattered across folders.
Every setting lives in a single .env file that holds API_ID, API_HASH, SESSION_FILE, DATABASE_DIR, CHAINDESK_AGENT_ID, and CHAINDESK_KEY.

## üîß Requirements
Node.js version eighteen or newer is needed.
A Telegram account must provide API credentials from my.telegram.org.
A Chaindesk workspace is optional but enables AI answers from your knowledge base.

## üí° Real World Use Cases
The bot can auto-answer private chats while you are away.
It can reject voice notes, send polite text instead, or forward pre-recorded audio clips on the spot.
A normal Telegram account can become a lightweight customer support agent that pulls answers directly from Chaindesk.

## üåü Reasons to Love It
No complex code so any JavaScript beginner can read it easily.
Full source code is available for immediate adaptation or extension.
ChatGPT can rewrite the entire file in one go because everything sits together.
Functions for sending text, audio, and photos are wrapped in clean promises that integrate smoothly with other Node scripts.
Error handling is predictable and external dependencies are kept minimal with tdl, prebuilt-tdlib, dotenv, and date-and-time.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Quick Reminders
Remember to swap the placeholder name, age, language, and hyperlinks in the OF prompt before deploying.
